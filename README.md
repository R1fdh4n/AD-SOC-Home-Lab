# AD-SOC-Home-Lab

This lab integrates Active Directory with a SOC using Splunk, focusing on AD management, log analysis, and threat detection. It includes simulated attacks to practice monitoring and incident response, providing hands-on experience in cybersecurity operations.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a home lab that integrates an Active Directory (AD) environment with a Security Operations Center (SOC) using Splunk. This lab aims to simulate real-world enterprise scenarios, focusing on AD administration, centralized log management, and threat detection. The setup will allow for hands-on experience in monitoring, detecting, and responding to security incidents, while also practicing incident response workflows and SOC operations.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- **Windows Server:** For setting up the Active Directory Domain Controller.
- **Windows 11:** As client machines joined to the AD domain.
- **Splunk:** For centralized log management, monitoring, and threat detection.
- **Sysmon (System Monitor):** For detailed logging of processes, network connections, and more.
- **Splunk Universal Forwarder:** For forwarding Windows logs to Splunk.
- **Kali Linux:** For simulating attacks against the AD environment.
- **Oracle VirtualBox/VMware Workstation:** For virtualizing the entire lab environment.
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

## Steps

## Acknowledgments:
I would like to express my gratitude to the creators and developers of the tools and scripts used in this project. Without their dedication and innovation, such advancements in cybersecurity would not be possible.

A special thanks to the MyDFIR, for his valuable contribution without his help it wouldn't have been possible to complete this project.
